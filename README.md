# Todo Application

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application locally.

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [Insert GitHub URL here]
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:
```bash
cd [project-directory]
```

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend application should now be running on `http://localhost:[frontend-port]`.


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors while running the application, please check the following:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
